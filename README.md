### Project Horizons

Description: 
Project Horizon is an immersive first-person adventure game set in a mysterious forest. The protagonist, residing in a humble hut, finds himself lost and trapped in an Iceland enveloped by dense fog. Your mission is to navigate through the fog and find your way back home. Along the journey, you will encounter various obstacles such as stones, hills, and boxes that hinder your progress. Overcome these challenges and rediscover your lost sanctuary.

Technology:  
This project is developed using Three.js, a powerful JavaScript library and API used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser. Three.js enables the creation of complex 3D environments and interactions directly in the browser, providing an excellent platform for developing immersive game experiences like Project Horizon.

- First-Person Perspective: Experience the game world directly through the eyes of the protagonist.
- Foggy Environment: Navigate through a dense fog that adds to the mystery and challenge.
- Dynamic Obstacles: Encounter and overcome various obstacles like stones, hills, and boxes.
- Immersive 3D Graphics: High-quality 3D graphics powered by Three.js.
